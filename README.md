# A Calc for Time Dialation and Length Contraction
A calculator for time dialation and length contraction. (According to theory of special relativity)

## Usage..?
You will be prompt to enter the speed of a moving object (that is, of course, moving relative to you).
And the program will calculate the 'speed' which the time in the object's frame travels (in terms of seconds) relative to yours and the length of the object you will observe (in terms of meters).
